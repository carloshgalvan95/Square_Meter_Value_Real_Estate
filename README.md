After evaluating the variables scraped from our website data source we identify a few important ones:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Amenities
- Location

Nevertheless, this could be due to the nature of the numbers and the data not being standardized and it's something we will be able to evaluate way better further down the road when we have a predictive model.
